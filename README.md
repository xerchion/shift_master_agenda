## Description



The project aims to generate a versatile work shift calendar, accommodating morning, afternoon, and night shifts. Users can effortlessly customize work shifts on chosen days using distinct colors. Notably, holidays are prominently indicated. The system offers flexibility for shift changes, including adjustments for overtime and additional bonuses.

## Features

- **Shift Management**: Easily generate a dynamic calendar/agenda for varying work shifts (morning, afternoon, and night). Users can select specific days and modify assigned shifts.

- **Color-Coded Shifts**: Each work shift is associated with a customizable color, making it easy to differentiate between different shifts.

- **Holiday Marking**: Holidays are highlighted on the calendar for quick reference. The system calculates holidays.

- **User Profiles**: The system includes tables in the database to store user profiles, making it easy to manage and assign shifts.

- **Shift Change Records**: Keep track of changed shifts with dedicated database tables, ensuring transparency in shift modifications.

- **Customized Colors**: Users can personalize the color scheme to suit their preferences, enhancing the visual experience.

- **Team Management**: Manage different work teams or groups with dedicated features for efficient scheduling.
